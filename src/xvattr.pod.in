=head1 NAME

@PACKAGE@ - Query/Set X11 XVideo Setting(s)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<@PACKAGE@> [I<options>...] 

This program is used for getting and setting X11 Xv attributes such as
XV_BRIGHTNESS, XV_CONTRAST, XV_SATURATION, XV_HUE, XV_COLORKEY, ...

For this program to work, you must have a version of X11 with the
XVideo extension and a graphics card that has Xv graphics acceleration.

Note: On some cards XV_BRIGHTNESS and XV_CONTRAST are not listed among
the available attributes, but they can still be set/changed.

=head2 OPTIONS

With no options, all parameters are displayed. 

Long options are handled by GNU getopts and follow those rules. In
particular, options that are specified with a double dash (--) rather
than a single dash (-), can be abbreviated as long as they are
unique. Long parameters that need a value specified may have the
parameter and the value separated with blank space or an optional
equals sign (and no intervening space).

For example the following are all equivalent:

@PACKAGE@ -a XV_BRIGHTNESS
@PACKAGE@ --attribute XV_BRIGHTNESS
@PACKAGE@ --att XV_BRIGHTNESS
@PACKAGE@ --att=XV_BRIGHTNESS

Example:

  > @PACKAGE@
  Adaptor: 0
  Name: Matrox G-Series Backend Scaler
   Port: 46
    Name: XV_COLORKEY
     Flags: XvGettable XvSettable 
     Min value: 0
     Max value: 16777215
     Current value: 66046

=over 

=item {-a | --attribute} I<attribute name>

Show value of attribute I<attribute name>

Example:

  > xvattr -a XV_BRIGHTNESS
  XV_BRIGHTNESS = 24

Z<>

=item {-a | --attribute} I<attribute name> [-v | --value] I<value>

Set attribute I<attribute name> to value I<value>.

Example:

  > xvattr -a XV_COLORKEY -v 10
  XV_COLORKEY set to 10

Z<>

=item {-p | --port} I<port number> 

Get the attribute on the specified port.  If -p is not set, the first
available port is used.

Example:

  > xvattr -p 66
